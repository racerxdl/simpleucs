Simple HTML5 UCS Visualizer Engine

The Code is pretty crap, but it works. Some tricks to not get out of sync when changing BPMs or so.

You will need UCS Music and Background image to run that. The game looks into ucs/img/CSXXX.jpg , ucs/mp3/CSXXX.mp3 or ucs/ogg/CSXXX.ogg depending on your browser compatibility.
